# VTEX Internal Docs Action

VTEX Internal Docs is an internal documentation solution that enables teams to 
collaborate seamlessly by having internal documentation distributed across 
multiple repos and rendered in a beautiful documentation portal available for 
all VTEX employees that have a github user in the `vtex` organization.

This GitHub Action syncs the documentation on your repository with the main 
[Internal Docs repo], which is used to build the Internal Docs website.

If you have any questions, reach out to us at [#tech-docs].

## Benefits

- A single place for all VTEX internal documentation: no more looking for docs 
  at notion or github wikis, go to a single place and find all your internal 
  docs needs.
- Find what you need easily: VTEX Internal Docs search works!
- Keep your docs close to your code: no need to open separate Pull requests in 
  other repos to document your systems.

## Architecture

VTEX Internal Docs is supposed to be used with a github workflow in order to 
send data from a github repo to `vtex/internal-docs` repo.

This workflow needs a token with write access to the `vtex/internal-docs` repo.

At any push to branches `main` or `master`, the workflow will grab all 
documentation inside `docs/` folder of your repo and will send it to the 
subfolder that you define on `docs-product` variable of the workflow.

## How to Use

1. Create a folder called `.github/workflows` in the root of your repo, if it 
   doesn't already exists.

2. Create a workflow inside your repo, for example `internal-docs.yml`

3. Fill the workflow with the following yml file. Don't forget to change the 
   `docs-product` variable.

```yml
name: "Internal Docs Integration"
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master
    - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: vtex/action-internal-docs@main
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_DOCS_GH_TOKEN }}
        docs-product: {YOUR_TEAM_NAME_HERE, e.g. Identity, Cloud-Services}
```

4. From now on, every push on branches `master` or `main` will sync your files 
   in the `docs/` folder to the `vtex/internal-docs` repo and it will be made 
   available on `https://internal-docs.vtex.com/`
